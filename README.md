Product Return and Warranty Tracker

 Overview
The **Product Return and Warranty Tracker** is an object-oriented Java project that helps businesses manage **product returns** and **warranty claims** efficiently.  
It ensures smooth handling of returns by validating warranty status, logging return requests, and tracking their resolution (refund, replacement, repair, or rejection).


 Problem Statement
Manual handling of product returns and warranties is error-prone and time-consuming.  
Businesses often lose track of warranty periods, which can lead to disputes and poor customer experience.  
This project provides a structured solution that **automates the process** and ensures reliability.



 Target Users
- **Retailers & Businesses** – to manage returns and warranties  
- **Customer Support Teams** – to track requests and provide faster resolution  
- **End Customers** (indirectly) – benefit from transparent and reliable service  


Object-Oriented Design

Core Classes
- **Customer** – stores customer details  
- **Product** – stores product details  
- **Warranty** – maintains warranty information (start & end date)  
- **ReturnRequest** – records and tracks return requests

OOP Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation** → Private attributes with public getters/setters  
- **Inheritance** → Specialized product types can extend `Product`  
- **Polymorphism** → `processReturn()` behaves differently for refund vs replacement  
- **Abstraction** → Interfaces/abstract classes define return policies  
- **Relationships** →  
  - Customer ↔ Product (association)  
  - Product ↔ Warranty (aggregation)  
  - ReturnRequest ↔ Product (composition)  

Future Enhancements
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
- Database integration for persistent storage  
- Reporting & analytics for return patterns  
- Web-based system for multi-user access
